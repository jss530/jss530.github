The content of your blog post goes here.

Day 1 - fixing my mistakes, cleaning up

--How to read error messages. Patience is a virtue. Fixing omniauth (can set it up using devise and a username only - show how you changed the initializer, the user model method, and made the views folder appear for sessions so you could change the fields).

Fixed all the forms, LOTS of troubleshooting!

Day 2:

--finally working on AJAX. re-watching the videos. starting to understand it more and more.
