Tomorrow marks exactly one month since I began the Fullstack Web Developer program. When I started this blog, I knew I was embarking on a journey - and boy, was I right! There have been some extreme highs and definitely some lows. I cannot express the elation you feel when your code works and all your tests pass -- I'm not going to lie, I've definitely sent screenshots of passing labs to friends and family -- nor can I explain the crushing defeat and frustration of working for days on a lab that just. won't. pass.

This month has taught me a lot about myself. It's taught me that I DO have the drive and ambition to do a self-guided program, and that I CAN be a student while working full time. It's also opened my eyes to the fact that I can push myself way too hard, and not in a good way. I am trying to work on slowing down, on accepting that not everything is going to go according to plan, and that relaxing and knowing when to step back is just as important as all the other stuff. 

Moving forward, I am going to write posts with more technical content - but I also think it's important to share some personal experiences, especially for other remote students like me. Here's to more adventure!
