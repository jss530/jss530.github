I'm just about finished with the HTML/CSS section of the curriculum, and I've come to realize that I'm really enjoying it. This has definitely been the most satisfying part of the course for me so far. What I like the most about it is that the results are immediate and gratifying -- as you're writing your code, you can keep refreshing the site you're working on to see what you've accomplished. I've taken a Front-end Development course before but I learned so much more this time around. It's been exciting to re-learn concepts and to find that what used to completely confuse me now makes complete sense. Does this mean I should head in the direction of front-end development? It's too early to tell.
