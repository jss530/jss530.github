*Don't panic*. This is what I told myself when I saw that according to the suggested topic, I should be much further along in the program than I am. This gives me anxiety. But then I remember that April was a crazy month - first, it's notoriously one of the busiest months at my company. Second, I had to move out of my apartment by April 15th. Add some family obligations and another college course (thankfully over) to the mix, and you see where I'm heading. I am very much looking forward to a fresh start and a normal schedule in May. It's been helpful to see other students are going through the same struggle.

On a happy note, I'm just about finished with the HTML/CSS section of the curriculum and I'm really enjoying it. This has definitely been the most satisfying part of the course for me so far. What I like the most is that the results are immediate and gratifying -- as you're writing your code, you can keep refreshing the website to see what you've accomplished. I've taken a Front-end Development course before but I learned so much more this time around. It's been exciting to re-learn concepts and to find that what used to completely confuse me now makes sense. Does this mean I should head in the direction of front-end development? It's too early to tell.
