*Imagine a world where everyone speaks a common language - or at least, where the foundations of everyone's languages are the same. A world where, once you learn this common foundation, you could apply it to learn all the other languages.  *

In another life, way before my move to the coding world, I was a linguist. I travelled to many countries and studied a variety of languages in the pursuit of one goal: finding, once and for all, a Common Grammar like the one described above. 

Anyone familiar with linguistics probably knows of Noam Chomsky, one of the fathers of Linguistics, and his theory of Universal Grammar. Chomsky was obsessed with finding the key building blocks that served as the foundation of all languages. His view of language was quite scientific. He saw it as something that came in layers - that if one could peel away the layers of slang and dialects and cultural references, one would reveal something that is quite clean, organized, and fairly formulaic. The key was FINDING what this formula is.

Chomsky first developed this theory in the 1950s. Since then, he has had many critics with theories that prove a Universal Grammar doesn't exist. Nevertheless, he still has followers that believe this formula can be found - and I was one of them.

Unfortunately, both myself and Chomsky have yet to find this elusive formula. But as I progress through this coding program, I can't help but think about how much the world of code parallels that of linguistics. Code, and the process of writing it, is a Chomskyan linguist's dream: it's (comparatively) simple, it's clean, and it's absolutely formulaic. It's possible that when Chomsky started to form his Universal Grammar theory in the 1950s, he was envisioning a language that the world just hadn't created yet.
