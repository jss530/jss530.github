As I've been progressing through this program, I've been picking up little tidbits here and there. I've been writing down the ones I find the most useful. Since I'm 1/3 of the way finished with this course, I thought now would be a good time to share some of my favorite tips so far: 

1. **Before starting to code, write your action plan out in plain language**.
    
		This doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a quick paragraph about what you will be coding, what you aim to    
		achieve, and the results you would like to obtain. 
		
     (I really liked this idea. Sometimes when starting a lab I think I know exactly what I want to do, but once I start coding 
		the plan can get jumbled up in my head. Being able to refer to my "plan of attack" is a great way to keep focused 
		on the task at hand).

2. **Next, figure out how to achieve this plan - namely, what objects do I need?**
  
    Let's say I want to build a program that allows users to make online reservations at restaurants. I then need to think 
		about what objects I need: for example, I'll definitely need User, Reservation, and Restaurant objects to start. I'll need 
		more objects as well, based on what else I want my program to do.
		
3. **Then, determine each object's responsibilities**.

    What should the User object be able to do? How about Restaurant? Reservation? Do they have any common behaviors? 
		How will they collaborate?
		
4. **Once you have your full plan laid out, start coding! **
    
		If you're still not sure where to begin, start by creating the method names for each object - in other words, build an 
		outline that you can fill in later.
		
5. **You're going to fail. Learn to view these fails as hints to help you find out what you're missing in your code.**

    My last blog was dedicated to the importance of failure in programming, so I won't get into much detail here.
		Just know that learning to re-set your attitude towards failure is paramount to becoming a successful coder.
