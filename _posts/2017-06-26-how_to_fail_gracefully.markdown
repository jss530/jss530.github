Learning to code can teach you a lot about success and failure. As a perfectionist, I get uncomfortable if I don't get something right on the first try. When I first started this coding program, I noticed there was a lot of discussion about failure, and about accepting failure as part of the journey to becoming a successful programmer. This was the complete antithesis to everything I had taught myself up until that point: failure as a part of success? Accepting that I won't accomplish a task right away? Impossible. Somewhere in my subconscious I think I was feeling: it won't happen to me. But alas, it eventually did.

There is a famous quote that goes: "Learning from success is important, but learning from failure is vital to succeeding." This statement couldn't be more true in the world of coding. I've realized that I am gradually undergoing a shift in mindset: if I fail a test, I work to find out why. Heck, sometimes even if I pass a test, I work to find out why! When I get a 'failed' result, I now try to see it as a challenge: what am I not noticing? What have I missed? What subjects do I need to study more in order to understand this concept better? I now see these failures as a sign of areas that need improvement. They are hints of what I need to do in order to become a better coder. They aren't an impediment to my success, they are an obstacle that I need to tackle in order to be the best I can be. 

I am not saying this change in mindset has been easy. If I'm not mindful, I find myself reverting to my old way of thinking when I fail a test and I get frustrated or annoyed. But if anything, this change will only help me in other aspects of my life.

It may seem a bit cliche, but maybe what they say is true -- failure IS success if you learn from it. And since we're being so cliche, I'll end with another one of my favorite quotes:

*"If at first you don't succeed - try, try again".*
