DAY 1: Figured out how to create a new rails app, plus add devise
	--- The best method I found was to use rails new commandsapp. Gave me all the folders and gems I needed to get started, and I was able to change the name of the master folder after.
	---Adding devise: the best site I found is https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication. Makes everything very clear, from installation to how to use it once inside the actual app
	---Spent the rest of night creating folders, initial migrations, and my action plan.

DAY 2: Omniauth!! Oh my. Starting a local server is SO important at this stage; wish I had started using it earlier. (link to blog that helped you set up). Then planned my action plan based on the flow I would like to take as a user

Day ¾: Reset, reset reset. How to roll your project back one if you make a major mistake. Which is what I have to do. The beauty of rake DB:reset. Don’t need seed! READ your error messages!
